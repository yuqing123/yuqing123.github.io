	<h1>Explore how many young adults live with their parents</h1>
	<p>
  	More and more young adults (18 to 34) now live with their parents, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The number jumped from 23% in 1960 to 31% in recent data. The increase has raised important questions regarding household formation and its impact on owning, renting, and the demand for new housing construction.

		Some studies have suggested that the reasons grown children are returning to the nest in greater numbers than ever may have less to do with the rise and fall of the unemployment rate, and more to do with lasting changes to young adult life, such as the growth of student debt and delayed marriage.
