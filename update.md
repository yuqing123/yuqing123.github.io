#What my final project will look like
- an interactive line chart showing the percentage change of young adults living with partents since 1980. 
- an interactive county level Choropleth Map showing percentage change.
- an interactive table with state level data on basic facts around young adults.

#What I've done
- Download relavant data from the census and manually compile all the fields I need them into csv file
- Write python script to compile the 1980 and 2009 csv files into one file, and calculate the percentage change
- Make a Choropleth Map based the new csv file
- Write python script to clean up the format of numbered data and convert the csv file into readable json file
- Make an interactive Google table using data from the json file

#What I still need to do
- Use Google chart to make the interactive line graphic
- Figure out how to add interactive toolbar to the Choropleth Map
- Find interesting outlier. For example, a county with a huge percentage increase and find out why.
- My graphics, data and python script are all over the folder, need to find a way organize them and put all the graphic on a single page
- Write CSS to style the index page
