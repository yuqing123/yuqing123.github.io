Santa Clara County has the seventh largest homeless populations - 7,567 people - in the country, according to the 2014 Annual Homeless Assessment Report (AHAR) to Congress.

Santa Clara County, even with its enormous wealth per capita because of Silicon Valley’s boom, has seen its homeless population increased by 5 percent in the past seven years, while the national number decreased by 11 percent.

Santa Clara County, even with its enormous wealth per capita because of Silicon Valley’s boom, had the largest percentage of unsheltered homeless in the country this year.

The county also has the largest percentage of unsheltered homeless - 75 percent - this year. Without any significant increase in the number of shelter beds, more people are living in cars, encampments or on the streets.

Recognizing the problem, the county and local cities have contributed to more permanent supportive housing, but not fast enough to keep up with the increase in population. 

To make matters worse, the soaring rent and low vacancy rate coming out of Silicon Valley’s recovering economy make efforts to house the homeless futile.

“We have more funds to help, but we don’t have the housing to place them in,” said Lori Collins, shelter director of InnVision Shelter Network.

Average asking rent in Santa Clara County has reached a record $2269 in 2014, almost $1,000 higher than a dacade ago. Occupancy rate also remained high as 95.3 percent, according to rental market researcher RealFact.com.

Being evicted by landlord has become the third main reason of homelessness, following job loss and alcohol/drug problems, according to the 2013 Santa Clara Homeless Point-in-time Census and Survey.

On December 4, San Jose shut down the country’s largest homeless encampment - a 68-acre land bordering Coyote Creek where about 300 people live in tents and tree houses. They called it “The Jungle.”

The San Jose City Council approved $4 million over two years in a Rapid Re-housing pilot program to permanently house people from the jungle in June 2013, and another $1.67 million to clean up the area this year.

Under the program, those from the Jungle who are currently employed or actively seeking employment can receive rental subsidies that allow them to pay 30% of their income towards rents, with a minimum of $20 a month, while the city pays for the difference. Those receiving subsides have to find a place within the San Jose city limit.

So far, 144 people have been housed. More than 60 people with the subsidies are still looking for landlords who don’t mind their “colorful background.”

“Some of them have been searching for a long time,” Said Kelly Hemphill with the San Jose homeless response team. 

Hemphill said the city has hired housing search specialist to help them locate apartments.

For those who have been homeless for years in the Jungle and scattered throughout the county, the county initiated a campaign to house 1,000 chronic homeless three years ago. A chronically homeless individual is someone who has experienced homelessness for a year or longer, or who has experienced at least four episodes of homelessness in the last three years and has a disability.

The first chronic homeless in the campaign was housed in 2012, and since then 800 people have been helped, according to Amanda Montez from Desitination: Home, a public-private partnership to end homelessness in the county. Reflected on the report is a 139 decrease in chronic homeless in the county in 2013.

Collins said one big challenge in housing chronic homeless is getting the community willing to help.

“Chronic homeless are actually second choices for landlords,” Collins said. “If I were a landlord choosing between one that has recently become homeless and another who has been homeless for ten years, who am I going to take? That’s an easy one.”

Meanwhile, Dolci said the ultimate solution to the homeless problem is to build more affordable housing.

“Shelter manages homelessness, doesn’t end homelessness,” said Dolci.

On Nov.18, 2014, San Jose approved a $17-per-square-foot rental impact fee, which requires apartment developers to pay the fee for the city to build more affordable housing.

Santa Clara County alone faces a $222 million gap in annual funding needed for affordable housing, according to a 2013 analysis by the Housing Trust of Silicon Valley.

“We are dead serious about getting more money for affordable housing,” Dolci said.

The homeless population is based on the county’s Point-in-Time count conducted over the course of two nights in January, when teams of homeless guides and volunteers canvassed the county for sheltered and unsheltered homeless persons. The numbers serve as an estimate of the actual number.

“Those numbers are not very reliable,” said Lori Collins. “When we see an increase, we don’t know if they just counted it better. It has a lot to do with learning how to count.”
