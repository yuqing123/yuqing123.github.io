	<h1>Explore how many young adults live with their parents</h1>
	<p>
  	More and more young adults (18 to 34) now live with their parents, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The number jumped from 23% in 1960 to 31% in recent data. The increase has raised important questions regarding household formation and its impact on owning, renting, and the demand for new housing construction.

Explore the data yourself.
