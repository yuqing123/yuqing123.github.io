In San Jose, a 65-acre land bordering Coyote Creek has the country’s largest homeless encampment, where between 200 and 300 people live in tents and tree houses. They called it “The Jungle.”
In June 2013, the San Jose City Council approved $4 million over two years in a Rapid Re-housing pilot program to permanently house people from the jungle. The 2014, the city also approved another $1.67 million to clear the encampment sites. 
Under the pilot program, those who are currently employed or are actively seeking employment only need to pay 30% of their income towards rents, with a minimum amount of $20 a month. Those receiving subsides have to find a place with in the San Jose city limit.
The money has helped 144 people find a roof of their heads. But more than 60 people with the subsidies are still looking for landlords who are willing to take them.
“Some of them have been searching for a long time. Landlords may not want to take people with such ‘colorful background.’” Said Kelly Hemphill with the San Jose homless response team.
On Nov.18, 2014, San Jose approved a $17-per-square-foot rental impact fee, which requires apartment developers to pay the fee for the city to build more affordable housing. 
Santa Clara County alone faces a $222 million gap in annual funding needed for affordable housing, according to a 2013 analysis by the Housing Trust of Silicon Valley.
“We are dead serious about getting more money for affordable housing,” Dolci said.
In 2011, the county initiated the Housing 1000 campaign to house 1,000 chronic homeless.
